# Helm
Helm is the package manager(like apt and yum for linux distribution) for the kubernetes and running on top of the kubernetes.  

## Helm Chart
Helm deploys charts, which you can think of as a packaged application. It is a collection of all your versioned, pre-configured application resources which can be deployed as one unit.
