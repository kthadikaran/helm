# Helm
Helm is the package manager(like apt and yum for linux distribution) for the kubernetes and running on top of the kubernetes.  

## Helm Chart
Helm Charts are simply Kubernetes YAML manifests combined into a single package(It is a collection of all your versioned, pre-configured application resources which can be deployed as one unit.) that can be deployed on the Kubernetes clusters. Once packaged, installing a Helm Chart into your cluster is as easy as running a single helm install, which really simplifies the deployment of containerized applications.
